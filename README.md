# weather_forecasts
repository of r script for analyzing weather forecasts

There are several components to this repo:
1. scripts cleaning weather observation data
2. scripts cleaning weather forecast data
3. scripts for introducing demographic data into weather datasets

This is part of an ongoing project looking at the (potential) economic impacts of weather forecast accuracy around severe weather events.
